# Roadmap: Origen Natural IPS Website

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a bilingual WordPress website for Origen Natural IPS integrative medicine clinic. The journey moves from foundation (theme, plugins, global components) through Spanish content creation (homepage, supporting pages, 10 service pages) to final translation and SEO optimization. All work is performed via browser automation in WordPress admin. Spanish content is completed before enabling translation to avoid incomplete bilingual states.
