## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Online booking/calendar system | WhatsApp is the preferred booking channel in Colombia (98% penetration) |
| E-commerce/online pharmacy | Physical pharmacy model, not ready for online sales |
| Patient portal/login | Adds complexity, not needed for clinic size |
| Custom theme development | Astra + Elementor provides sufficient customization |
| Multi-location support | Single location for v1, expansion comes later |
| Chat widget (non-WhatsApp) | WhatsApp is the standard in Colombia market |
