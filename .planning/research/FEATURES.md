### Rationale for Table Stakes

These features represent the minimum viable clinic website. Research shows:
- 77% of patients search online before booking ([Digital Silk](https://www.digitalsilk.com/digital-trends/best-healthcare-website-design-examples/))
- 90% read online reviews/trust signals before choosing a provider ([1SEO](https://1seo.com/blog/social-proof-in-healthcare-marketing-how-to-gain-patient-trust/))
- Contact information visibility is the #1 complaint about medical websites ([MedResponsive](https://www.medresponsive.com/blog/medical-website-design-mistakes-you-need-to-avoid/))

## Differentiators

Features that set great clinic sites apart. Not expected, but create competitive advantage.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Full bilingual support (Spanish/English)** | Captures international patient market; professional image | Medium | WPML or Polylang plugin; full content translation required |
| **Patient testimonials with photos/video** | 93% satisfaction rate is powerful - showcase it; builds trust | Medium | Video testimonials highest impact; HIPAA/Habeas Data consent required |
| **Before/after results gallery** | Visual proof for therapies like Sueroterapia; differentiates from competitors | Medium | Patient consent essential; powerful for IV therapy, physical therapy |
| **Educational blog content** | Positions clinic as authority; improves SEO significantly | Medium-High | Regular posts on conditions treated; reviewed by medical staff |
| **"Conditions we treat" landing pages** | Captures search traffic ("migraine treatment Bogota"); patient-focused | Medium | One page per major condition; link to relevant therapies |
| **Virtual clinic tour / facility photos** | Shows modern equipment; reduces anxiety about alternative medicine | Low-Medium | Professional photography; shows Campo Magnetico equipment, pharmacy |
| **FAQ section** | Answers common questions; reduces phone calls; SEO benefit | Low | What to expect, pricing info, preparation instructions |
| **Meet the team page with philosophy** | Integrative medicine patients value philosophy alignment | Low | Beyond credentials - share why they practice integrative medicine |
| **Treatment preparation guides** | Reduces anxiety; shows professionalism; practical value | Low | "What to expect from Sueroterapia", "How to prepare for Acupuntura" |
| **Google Business Profile optimization** | Local SEO critical; appears in "near me" searches | Low | Free but essential; photos, reviews, hours, services |

### High-Impact Differentiators for Origen Natural

Given the clinic's context, these three differentiators provide maximum ROI:

1. **Bilingual (Spanish/English)**: Opens international patient market, differentiates from local-only competitors
2. **Testimonials featuring 93% satisfaction**: Powerful social proof; integrative medicine patients rely heavily on peer experience
3. **Condition-focused content**: Captures patients searching for solutions ("back pain treatment Bogota") not therapies

## Anti-Features

Features to deliberately NOT build. Common mistakes that harm clinic websites.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Online appointment scheduling system** | Overkill for CTA model; adds complexity and maintenance; WhatsApp preferred in Colombia | Keep WhatsApp as primary CTA; simpler and culturally appropriate |
| **Patient portal with health records** | HIPAA/Habeas Data complexity; massive maintenance; overkill for clinic size | Use existing systems; focus website on marketing/conversion |
| **E-commerce for supplements** | Inventory management; legal/regulatory complexity for medical products in Colombia | Partner with pharmacy or use external platforms if needed |
| **Live chat with staff** | Requires real-time staffing; WhatsApp serves same purpose better | WhatsApp handles async messaging better; staff already use it |
| **Complex animation/video backgrounds** | Slows load time; accessibility issues; distracts from content | Subtle animations only; optimize all media |
| **Auto-playing video/audio** | Annoying; accessibility issue; increases bounce rate | User-initiated play only |
| **Intrusive pop-ups on entry** | 70% of users find annoying; Google penalizes; damages first impression | Exit-intent only if needed; never block content |
| **Medical jargon in service pages** | Patients don't understand; reduces conversion; integrative medicine needs accessible language | Write for patients, not doctors; explain in simple terms |
| **Stock photos of generic doctors** | Damages trust; patients know they're fake; integrative medicine values authenticity | Real photos of actual staff and facility only |
| **Complex navigation with many dropdowns** | Confuses patients; increases bounce; medical sites need simplicity | Max 5-7 main items; flat structure preferred |
| **Pricing hidden or vague** | Patients distrust hidden pricing; Colombian market expects transparency | At minimum provide ranges or "starting from" pricing |
| **Heavy reliance on medical disclaimers** | Creates distrust; suggests you doubt your own services | Minimal necessary disclaimers; focus on positive outcomes |
| **Social media feed embeds** | Slows page; design inconsistency; external content you don't control | Link to social profiles; don't embed feeds |
| **Newsletter pop-up immediately** | Asks for commitment before providing value; high bounce | Offer newsletter after value demonstrated (blog, resources) |
| **Over-designed "creative" layouts** | Medical sites need trust and clarity; creativity can confuse | Clean, professional, predictable layouts; innovation in content not structure |

### Why These Are Anti-Features Specifically for This Project

1. **WhatsApp vs Online Scheduling**: Colombia has 98%+ WhatsApp penetration. Patients prefer messaging. Online scheduling adds complexity without proportional benefit.

2. **Patient Portal**: For a 10-service integrative clinic, building HIPAA/Habeas Data compliant patient portals is massive overkill. Patients don't expect it from this clinic type.

3. **Authenticity over Polish**: Integrative medicine patients specifically value authenticity. Stock photos and over-designed sites actually reduce trust in this vertical.

## Colombia-Specific Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- **Law 1581 of 2012 (Habeas Data)**: Privacy policy required; patient consent for data collection; right to access/modify personal data
- **Law 2015 of 2020**: Electronic medical records interoperability (not website-related but context)
- Health data is "sensitive data" under Colombian law - requires explicit consent

### Market Preferences
- **WhatsApp dominance**: Primary communication channel; patients expect it
- **Spanish first**: All content primary in Spanish; English secondary for international
- **Local trust signals**: Colombian certifications, local address, local phone number
- **Price sensitivity**: Transparency about costs reduces friction

### SEO Considerations for Bogota
- Target "medicina integrativa Bogota" keywords
- Local schema markup
- Google Business Profile essential
- NAP consistency across directories
